Based on past experience, in order to initiate a new round of trend-based upward movement and break through previous highs, new catalysts are needed. There is a high probability of the market entering a period of sideways consolidation. Attention should be focused on the new directions chosen by the market, particularly opportunities in the subsequent market trends of power equipment and non-ferrous metals. Global pro-cyclical trading in the fourth quarter will act as a catalyst for the subsequent market. As for gold hitting new highs, the current price has slightly outpaced real interest rates. A new driving force can only be formed by long-term expectations of rising inflation. Paying attention to the sources of inflation in industrial goods and gold is equally important. After gold prices hit new highs, gold stocks at historically low valuation levels in this round will have more resilience compared to gold prices.",3755106,朱雪莹

However, after a sustained increase in long-term bond rates, central banks and finance ministries typically intervene more heavily, potentially limiting further upward movement in rates; (2) In the medium to long term, loose fiscal policy becomes the main theme, with long-term bond term premiums potentially remaining elevated: Increased economic pressure amid the trade war, combined with rising defense spending in economies like Europe under deglobalization, will lead to calls for loose fiscal policy.",3755098,朱雪莹
